## 2026-08-02: mask switch, s2_mask to s2_dlmask

Tile 32UNU, 20 cubes, 9,486,336 finite pixels.

Clear-sky fraction over all finite pixels, three definitions:

| definition | clear fraction |
|---|---|
| `s2_mask == 0` (legacy sen2flux/Sen2Cor lineage) | 0.4263 |
| `s2_dlmask == 0` (variable switch alone) | 0.4815 |
| `s2_dlmask == 0` AND `s2_SCL in (1,2,4,5,6,7)` (**adopted**) | 0.4570 |

The SCL conjunction removes a further 5.1% of dlmask-clear pixels.

**Correction to the figures quoted when this switch was requested.** The
0.366 -> 0.509 shift was measured on a single cube, the first one listed. Over
all 20 the shift is **0.4263 -> 0.4570**, a relative gain of +7.2% in usable
pixels, not +39%. Effective sample size per probe therefore rises modestly.

Per-cube under the adopted definition:

```
valid fraction    min 0.372  median 0.455  max 0.555
frames >50% clear min 10     median 13     max 16     (of T ~= 29)
NDVI valid frac   median 0.455
NDVI median       min 0.592  median 0.747  max 0.822
```

Snow: `s2_dlmask` has no snow class (0 clear, 1 thick cloud, 2 thin cloud,
3 cloud shadow). Snow is masked through the SCL half instead, since 11 is not
in the allow-list. Under the legacy mask snow was only 0.00054 of finite pixels
in this tile and window, so the practical effect here is negligible, but it is
the reason the conjunction is not optional.

Evidence for the lineage claim is in the cubes themselves, not only the paper:

- `s2_dlmask.attrs["description"]`: "Deep Learning Cloud Mask, trained by Vitus
  Benson on cloudSEN12, leveraging code from Cesar Aybar."
- `s2_mask.attrs["description"]`: "sen2flux Cloud Mask", with class 4 being
  "masked by SCL".

## 2026-08-02: adopted climatology definition

Per-pixel NDVI climatology, adopted verbatim in behaviour from
`model_pixelwise/climatology.py` in vitusbenson/greenearthnet:

> For a target year, pool NDVI from **all other years**, keep pixels where
> `s2_dlmask == 0` and `s2_SCL` is in `(1,2,4,5,6,7)`, linearly interpolate
> remaining gaps along time, group by day-of-year and average across years,
> then smooth with a 30-day centred rolling mean over a wrap-padded year and
> drop the 30 padding days at each end.

Two notes on our implementation in `data/climatology.py`:

- NDVI comes from `data.ndvi.ndvi`, which returns NaN where
  `|B8A + B04| < 1e-12`. GreenEarthNet instead adds `1e-8` to the denominator.
  The two agree everywhere the denominator is not near zero; ours declines to
  guess where it is.
- **Not computable on the current subset.** Every cube in 32UNU is from 2018,
  and the definition requires at least one year other than the target year.
  `ndvi_climatology` raises `SingleYearError` rather than inventing a
  within-year substitute. It becomes available at scale-up.

## 2026-08-02: year-grouped CV deferred

`probes/cv.py` keeps a year-grouped mode, but it raises `SingleYearError` when
the manifest contains one year, which is the case for the whole 32UNU subset.
The year-leakage check is therefore **deferred to scale-up**. Spatial grouping
is unaffected and remains the operative split for Phase 1.3.
